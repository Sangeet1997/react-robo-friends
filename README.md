## Project Overview

The project was created to learn React basics, such as state management and components. It features a card list of friends (called "robo-friends") that can be filtered by a search input. The app dynamically updates the displayed list based on the user's search query.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search:** Filters through the list of robo-friends as you type in the search box.
- **Component-based Design:** Uses separate components for each part of the UI, such as the search bar, card list, and individual cards.
- **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` hook to manage the app's state and update the displayed list of friends.
